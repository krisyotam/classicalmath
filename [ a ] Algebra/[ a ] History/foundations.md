# Foundations of Algebra 

Algebra was derived from a arabic mathematical treatise known as Al-kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-gabr wa'l-muqabala which was written in
bagdad around 820 by the Persian Polymath Al-Khwarizmi. The word algebra itself was later borrowed into Medieval latin as algebraica. 
This can be translated into english with title becoming: The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing.
Algebra means restoration or completion. It heavily involved taking from one side and adding to another side of a equation. 
Al-Khwarizimi was not the first person to discover algebra. The historical roots for algebra were around 2000 BC on tablets
stolen from Ancient Babylon. Ancient Babylon was in the region named Mesopotamia meaning between two rivers. 


the ultimate etymology of the word "algebra" itself, later borrowed into Medieval Latin as algebrƒÅica.
