#### Motivation 
> "Education is the kindling of a flame, and not the filling of a vessel."  
> — Socrates

As the above quote seeks to explain Education should be akin to the kindling of a flame, and less the filling of a vessel. True Education should spark curiosity, inspire ciritical thinking, and foster and immense passion for any given subject. 
In modern times this type of learning has been replaced by [Rote Memorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning), and [Passive Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_learning). Whilst is made nie impossible due to [Information Overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload), and lack of understanding of what I refer to as the [Liberal Arts Quadrivium](), based liberally on the [Trivium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium). 

This type of menial education plagued my childhood and left me starving for true knowledge while being forcefead babble. Upon re-entering University for Mathematics I noticed the pattern reering to continue itself. I decided to take a gap semester and focus on building a supplamentative curriculum to go along with my formal one that would properly kindle my flame.

#### What is this?
- A revised approach to learning mathematics in a classical sense as defined well by Daniel Maycock [here](https://polymathclassical.com/what-is-classical-mathematics/).
- A way for math philomaths to gain a deeper understanding of the history, purpose, and art of mathematics.
- A more meaningful attempt at developing [Logical Intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition), and [Mathematical Maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity).
- A dive into Mathematical Philosophy that should have you question the nature and implications of mathematical concepts. 


#### What this isn't. 
- A rigirous guide containing endless problems. I have lots of those that can be visited [here](https://krismathblog.vercel.app/pages/html/projects.html) on my blog.
- A exhausitive alternative to formal education or more filled out methods of learning mathematics such as curricula by [OSSU Math](https://github.com/ossu/math).
- A strict program with defined timelines or outcomes, this is passion for passions sake and will *probably have little to no translation to monetary value.
- A replacement for Hands-On-Practice; Reading documentations of my practice does not equate to going through the struggle yourself. If you want to do this project do it the hard way, and take a [Deep Dive](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deep%20dive).

#### Structure 
As previously mentioned, this will be fairly loosely structured, and I will do my best to update this section as it evolves. I tend to include reflections in which I discuss the Deep Dives, what was learned in each section, the insights I gained, and even include problem sets with solutions for those that I believe were particularly beneficial for understanding various outcomes and processes.

For now the structure I have decided on is below and can be read about [here](https://github.com/krisyotam/classicalmath/blob/main/structure.md).
